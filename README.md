Hi there! 👋

I’m a passionate and motivated Back-End Developer specializing in .NET technologies, particularly ASP.NET Core and C#. I focus on building scalable, maintainable, and secure APIs and server-side applications using:
🛠️ Entity Framework Core
🔍 LINQ
🧩 SQL Server
🧱 Repository Pattern, Dependency Injection, and Layered Architecture
📱 From iOS to .NET – My Journey
I began my development journey with iOS development using Swift and SwiftUI, which taught me essential programming principles and UI/UX thinking. But I quickly found that my real passion lies in the backend — solving logic problems, working with databases, and designing robust systems that scale.
🚀 What I'm Doing Now
📚 Deepening my understanding of .NET 8 and ASP.NET Core Web APIs

🔄 Working on personal projects that apply Clean Architecture and SOLID principles
🧪 Exploring tools like Postman, Swagger, Git, and Visual Studio
🧠 Always learning, improving, and staying updated with the latest backend trends

🌟 What I Value
Writing clean, efficient, and testable code
Collaborating with others and learning from feedback
Solving real-world problems with thoughtful solutions
Continuously growing as a developer

📫 Let’s Connect
I’m actively looking for opportunities as a Junior .NET Backend Developer where I can grow, contribute, and build impactful software solutions.
Feel free to check out my projects, give feedback, or just say hi!
